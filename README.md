# Project for the exam in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

This repository contains the report and the code of the project of Alessandro Cesa for the exam in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition by prof. Felice Andrea Pellegrino, in the academic year 2023/24

The project consists in the training and testing of a Convolutional Neural Network to classify 15 different categories, using the provided dataset. On `CVPR_2023_Projects_assignments.pdf` you can find the complete project assignement.

The report is contained in the file `report.pdf`; the code used to train and test the models is contained in the $4$ jupyter notebooks, while the functions used in the notebooks are stored in the python files in the folder `functions`.

The Dataset is contained in the folder `CVPR2023_project_2_and_3_data` and it's already split between test set and training set; it's also available as compressed file at `CVPR2023_project_2_and_3_data.zip`.

In order to reproduce the results, it's sufficent to clone this repository and run the notebooks; also, the following libraries are needed: pytorch,torchvision,numpy,scikit-learn,matplotlib,pandas, seaborn.
